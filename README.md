# Tempidity-Luxe
A sensor board for TI OPT3001 Ambient Light Sensor and the TI HDC1080 Low Power, High Accuracy Digital Humidity Sensor with Temperature Sensor.

This board samples the following:
* Light (lux)
* Relative Humidity (%)
* Temperature (degrees celcius)

While this board is protyping friendly (aka bread-board) it is intdened that it be conected to a hosting board for production use. 
For accurtate readings the sensors require no objects to be near them that could reflect or generate heat. 
Having these sensors isolated on this â€œdaughter" board provides flexibile deployment options.
